A machine learning project that classifies and visualizes the political leaning of text content using natural language processing and dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Description

The Political Bias Visualizer is a web application that analyzes text content to determine its political bias (Left, Center, or Right) and visualizes the results in an interactive interface. The project uses TF-IDF vectorization, SVM classification, and UMAP for dimensionality reduction to create meaningful visualizations of political bias patterns.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: Classifies text content as Left, Center, or Right leaning
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualizes text in a 2D space using UMAP dimensionality reduction
- **Real-time Analysis**: Analyze user-provided text and see where it falls on the political spectrum
- **Probability Distribution**: Shows the confidence scores for each political classification
- **Comprehensive Training Data**: Trained on a diverse dataset covering various political ideologies
